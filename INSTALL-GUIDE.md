#Installation1. Burn the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperproject/files/jasper-disk-image.tar.gz/download">Jasper image</a> to a SD card (e.g. Win32 Disk Imager) and install to your raspberry-pi unit and power up2. SSH into your raspberry-pi using your favorite SSH terminal. (e.g. MobaXterm)  The default username/password is pi/raspberry.3. Expand the file system so the entire SD card is available for use.  This will require you to reboot afterwards.    <pre>    sudo raspi-config    </pre>4. **OPTIONAL:**  Configure your raspberry-pi to use wifi.  Follow the instructions <a href="http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/usage/#selecting-network">here</a> to setup your wifi dongle.  First open the **interfaces** file with a text editor:    <pre>    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces    </pre>    Replace the contents of the file with the following, substituting the items in red for the actual values of your wifi network:    <pre>auto lo    iface lo inet loopback    iface eth0 inet dhcp    allow-hotplug wlan0    auto wlan0    iface wlan0 inet dhcp            wpa-ssid &quot;<span style="color:red">YOUR_NETWORK_SSID</span>&quot;            wpa-psk &quot;<span style="color:red">YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD</span>&quot;	</pre>    NOTE: Commands in wicd-curses are **case sensitive**, so make sure you are using UPPERCASE letters for accessing menus.5. Install Jasper by using git to clone from the source repository.  Disable Jasper from starting automatically upon boot.    <pre>    git clone https://github.com/FutureTense/jasper-client jasper -b isy    ~/jasper/setup/disable-jasper-boot.sh    </pre>6. Update raspberry-pi (will automatically reboot)    <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/update-raspberrypi.sh    </pre>7. Update the firmware of the raspberry-pi (which is also stored on the SD card)    <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/firmware.sh    sudo reboot    </pre>8. **OPTIONAL:** If you wish to use USB speakers, this script will allow the USB speakers to be used by the raspberry-pi.    <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/usb-audio.sh    sudo reboot    </pre>9.  Set the audio levels of your microphone and speakers and then test them by using the **alsamixer** gui.    <pre>    alsamixer    </pre>    Experiment with the speaker and microphone levels to find values that suit you.  Save these level values and you can add these to the **jasper.conf** file later.  To test the equipment, the following script will record 3 seconds of audio, then play it back for you.      <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/audiotest.sh    </pre>10.  Install the prerequisite modules required for Jasper.    <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/jasper-prereq.sh    </pre>Congratulations!  Jasper is now installed.  All that is left is to do is setup the configuration file.  NOTE:  You do not need to populate every value in the configuration file.  It all depends on which modules you want to install.#<a id="Configuration"></a>ConfigurationThe file **~/jasper/jasper.conf** contains information about your system divided into sections.  The sections and their contents are discussed below.##ProfileThis section contains basic information about the owner of the Jasper device.   ####This value is used for weather requests.  Location should be a 5-digit US zipcode (e.g., 08544). If you are outside the US, insert the name of your nearest big town/city.location='90210'####Please enter a timezone from the list located in the TZ* column at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_database\_time\_zones, or none at all. timezone=US/Eastern##isyThis section contains the address and login credentials of your isy device.   ####Enter the ip address of your isy deviceServer=192.168.1.40####Enter the isy usernameusername=isyuser####Enter the isy passwordpassword=isypassword##devicesThis section contains information about insteon devices that can be controlled by your isy.  Each entry refers to a different device.  The left side is the name of the device that you will use when writing your Jasper modules.  The right side is the address of the *scene* or *device* that Jasper will attempt to send commands too.  You can add an optional "status" device by adding a ", <device id>.   This is used in the case where you have a scene that controls many devices, but you want one of the controls to be used to check the on/off status of a scene.  For example:bedroom=6672,14 FF 12 1Whenever Jasper sends a command to *bedroom*, it will send the on/off command to scene 6672.  When Jasper wants to find out the status of the bedroom scene, it will query the device whose id is "14 FF 12 1", which is presumably a member of the isy scene.#Setting up a module <TODO>#Running JasperNow that you have populated **jasper.conf** you are ready to test Jasper.  When you installed Jasper, you ran a script which disabled the startup script from executing when booting.  To start Jasper, manually start this script by running:<pre>    ~/jasper/boot/boot.sh</pre>This will start Jasper and you can watch the output in the console.  If you want to stop Jasper, this command will do just that:<pre>    pkill python</pre>After the boot.sh script has been run at least once, you can start Jasper by running:<pre>    cd ~/jasper/client    python main.py</pre>Once you are satisfied and you are ready for Jasper to start every time the unit boots, issue the following command:    <pre>    ~/jasper/setup/enable-jasper-boot.sh    </pre>
